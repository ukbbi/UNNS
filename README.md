# 🌌 UNNS Framework

**Unbounded Nested Number Sequences / Universal Network Nexus System**

A universal mathematical substrate for exploring **nested recursions, attractors, and cross-domain homomorphisms**.

---

## 📖 Introduction

The **UNNS framework** is an experimental mathematical and symbolic system built around the idea of **nested sequences** and their **universal patterns**.

At its core, UNNS shows how classical sequences (Fibonacci, Tribonacci, Pell, Padovan, Catalan, etc.) are **not isolated curiosities**, but **faces of a single deeper structure**.  

This structure connects **algebra, geometry, topology, number theory, and symbolic reasoning** into one substrate.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Recursive Nests**  
  Numbers grow by applying combinator rules:  
  `aₙ = f(aₙ₋₁, aₙ₋₂, …)` → infinite unfolding nests.

- **Attractors & Constants**  
  Each sequence converges to characteristic constants  
  (golden ratio φ, silver ratio δ, plastic constant ρ),  
  acting as **spiral attractors in symbolic space**.

- **Prime Filters**  
  Modular residues highlight **domains**, revealing  
  structure in sequences under modular arithmetic.

- **Cross-Domain Homomorphism**  
  Mappings preserve structure across domains:  
  - concatenation → addition  
  - string → residue class  
  - sequence → spiral projection

- **Semantic Overlays**  
  Nests can carry symbolic tags (`validated`, `unstable`, `prime-nest`, `entropy node`)  
  → enabling **cognitive-style interpretation**.

## 🧪 Hypothesis

> All linear recurrence sequences and many classical mathematical systems  
> can be re-expressed as **nested generators** inside the UNNS substrate.  

This suggests UNNS acts as a **universal mathematical operating framework**,  
not limited to one branch of math.
