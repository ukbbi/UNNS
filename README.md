 UNNS Many-Faces Theorem: Interactive Visualization & Formal Framework

A mathematical framework and interactive visualization tool for exploring the Unbounded Nested Number Sequences (UNNS) system and its Many-Faces Theorem, demonstrating how diverse mathematical sequences emerge from a unified computational substrate.

 üåü Overview

The UNNS (Unbounded Nested Number Sequences / Universal Network Nexus System) framework provides a unified approach to understanding linear recurrence sequences, their geometric attractors, modular properties, and cross-domain mappings. This repository contains:

- Interactive HTML5 visualization tool with 2D/3D graphics
- Formal theorem statements and proof sketches (PDF documents)
- Python verification scripts for numerical analysis
- Constructive embeddings for classic sequences (Fibonacci, Pell, Tribonacci, etc.)

 üìö The Many-Faces Theorem

The core theoretical result shows that a single UNNS system can simultaneously exhibit multiple mathematical "faces":

 Theorem Statement
Let U = (S, C, G, {Œº_D}) be a UNNS system where:
- **S** = set of nests (symbolic tokens or integers)
- **C** = finite set of combinators (bounded-lookback operators)
- **G** = finite seed set
- **Œº_D** = computable domain mappings

Then the system exhibits:

1. **Linear Recurrence Embedding**: Any linear recurrence a_n = c‚ÇÅa_{n-1} + ... + c_r a_{n-r} can be exactly embedded
2. **Dominant-Root Attractor**: Convergence to the characteristic polynomial's dominant eigenvalue
3. **Modular Domain Partition**: Residue classes mod m create finite-state subsystems
4. **Cross-Domain Homomorphism**: Constructive mappings between different encodings
5. **Computational Completeness**: With appropriate combinators, Turing completeness is achievable

 üíª Python Verification

```python
 Example: Verify Fibonacci convergence
import json
from verify_convergence import verify_unns_convergence

with open('unns_fibonacci_50.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    results = verify_unns_convergence(data)
    print(f"Convergence error: {results['final_error']:.2e}")
    print(f"Dominant root: {results['dominant_root']:.10f}")

üîß Technical Implementation
UNNS Combinator Example (Fibonacci)
S = ‚Ñ§ (integers)
G = {0, 1} (seeds)
C = {‚òÖ} where ‚òÖ(x,y) = x + y
Œº_Z: S ‚Üí ‚Ñ§ (identity mapping)

Sequence generation:
s‚ÇÄ = 0, s‚ÇÅ = 1
s_{n+1} = ‚òÖ(s_{n-1}, s_n) = s_{n-1} + s_n
