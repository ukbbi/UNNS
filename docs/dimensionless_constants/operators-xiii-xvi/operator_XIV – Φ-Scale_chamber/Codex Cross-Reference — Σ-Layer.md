## Codex Cross-Reference — Σ-Layer (Structural Admissibility Interface)

### Status
**New primitive (non-operator)**  
Discovered empirically in Chamber XIV (Φ-Scale).

### Definition

**Σ-Layer (Structural Admissibility Interface)**  
A forced, non-generative layer that mediates between operator-produced structures and admissible aggregation.  
Σ does not act on structures; it constrains which structures may be meaningfully composed, aggregated, or certified.

### Ontological Classification

| Property | Operators (Φ, Ψ, τ, XII) | Σ-Layer |
|--------|---------------------------|---------|
| Acts on structures | ✔ | ✘ |
| Produces / transforms states | ✔ | ✘ |
| Generates candidates | ✔ | ✘ |
| Filters admissibility | ✘ | ✔ |
| Composable / iterable | ✔ | ✘ |
| Optional | ✔ | ✘ |
| Forced / mandatory | ✘ | ✔ |

Σ is therefore **not an Operator** and must not be notated as one.

### Functional Role in the Substrate

Σ operates as a **structural interface** that separates:

> numerical convergence  
> from  
> structural admissibility

Operators may generate minima, attractors, or apparent invariants; Σ determines whether these outcomes are **eligible for aggregation or interpretation**.
