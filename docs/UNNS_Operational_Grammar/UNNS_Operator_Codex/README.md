# UNNS — Unbounded Nested Number Sequences  
## Canonical Structure, Chambers, and Operator Codex

This repository contains the **canonical research corpus of UNNS** (Unbounded Nested Number Sequences):  
a recursive substrate framework developed through **formal operators**, **computational chambers**, and **validated papers**.

The project is organized around a strict separation of roles:

- **Operator Codex** — what operations exist
- **Chambers** — how operators behave in controlled experiments
- **Papers** — what has been formally demonstrated and interpreted

This README provides the **navigation map between these layers**.

## 1. Operator Codex (Foundational Grammar)

The **Operator Codex** defines the *complete operational alphabet* of the UNNS substrate.

**Authoritative reference (latest):**  
📄 `unns_operators_complete_reference_patched.html`  
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Scope:**
- Operators **0 – XVII**
- Registry tags (post–Chamber XXXVII):
  - Operator class (S-OP / G-OP / B-OP / M-OP)
  - Ontological status
  - Composability status
- Canonical formulas, roles, and meanings

**Location:**
docs/
└── UNNS_Operational_Grammar/
└── UNNS_Operator_Codex/


The Codex is **normative**:  
> Chambers and papers must conform to it — never redefine it.

## 2. Canonical Chambers (Experimental Validation)

Chambers are **computational laboratories** that test operator behavior under controlled constraints.  
They do **not** introduce new operators — they validate *admissibility, stability, and composability*.

### Core Active Chambers

#### **Chamber XXXIV — Ω-Only Diagnostics**
- Tests Ω-level stationarity independently of τ
- Establishes background coherence constraints  
🔗 https://unns.tech/media/unns/chamber_xxxiv/chamber_xxxiv_OMEGA_ONLY_v1_2_0.html

---

#### **Chamber XXXV — Ω → τ Admissibility**
- Determines which τ-operators remain admissible under fixed Ω
- Establishes Ω→τ coupling rules  
🔗 https://unns.tech/media/unns/chamber_xxxv/chamber_xxxv.html  
🔗 Higgs-mode extension: https://unns.tech/media/unns/chamber_xxxv/chamber_xxxv_higgs.html

---

#### **Chamber XXXVI — Structural Separation**
- Empirically demonstrates **separation between Ω-stationarity and τ-admissibility**
- Validated result:
  - Mode A: Ω stable + τ admissible
  - Mode B: Ω unstable + τ admissible  
- Central implication:  
  **Quantization may survive at τ-level even when Ω-background coherence fails**

🔗 https://unns.tech/media/unns/chamber_xxxvi/chamber_xxxvi_structural_redesign.html

---

#### **Chamber XXXVII — Operator Composability**
- Tests *whether operators remain valid under composition*
- Introduces **composability gates**:
  - G_τ (τ-drift)
  - G_Ω (Ω-drift)
  - G₂ (residual contraction ordering)
- Establishes composability as a **measurable law**, not an assumption

κ-Chambers — Conditional Structural Refinement

The κ-chambers investigate post-τ structural refinement. Unlike Ω- or τ-chambers, κ-chambers do not test admissibility or stabilization. Instead, they examine whether additional geometric or ordering structure can emerge only after τ-level admissibility has already been established.

κ-operators act strictly downstream of τ and cannot repair inadmissible dynamics or unstable backgrounds.

Canonical role:

Ω  →  τ  →  κ
│     │     │
│     │     └─ conditional refinement / curvature / ordering
│     └─ admissibility & stabilization
└─ background coherence

Included κ-Chambers

Chamber κ₀ — Baseline κ Behavior
https://unns.tech/media/unns/chamber_kappa/chamber_kappa_zero.html

Establishes the null behavior of κ-operators acting on minimally τ-admissible substrates. Demonstrates that κ does not introduce stability, admissibility, or structure on its own.

Chamber κ₁ — Conditional κ Emergence
https://unns.tech/media/unns/chamber_kappa/chamber_kappa1_1.html

Demonstrates that κ-level structure may emerge conditionally for specific τ-relaxed configurations, without forming a universal κ-law. This behavior motivated the formal operator composability gates introduced in Chamber XXXVII.

Relation to Later Chambers

κ-chambers do not define a new admissibility layer

κ-chambers justify the need for explicit composability testing

κ-behavior is formally constrained by Chamber XXXVII (Operator Composability)

In particular, κ₁ provides early empirical evidence that downstream operators may succeed or fail depending on τ-level structure, motivating the composability criteria formalized in Chamber XXXVII.

## 3. Papers (Formal Results)

Papers extract **theoretical meaning** from chamber data.  
They are conservative, reviewer-safe, and falsifiable.

## 4. How These Pieces Fit Together

Operator Codex (0–XVII)
↓
Chambers XXXIV–XXXVII
↓
Validated Papers


- **Codex** defines what *can* exist
- **Chambers** test what *survives*
- **Papers** state what *has been demonstrated*

No layer overrides another.

---

## 5. Project Status

- Operator grammar: **stable**
- Ω→τ admissibility: **validated**
- Ω vs τ separation: **empirically demonstrated**
- Operator composability: **experimentally measurable**
- Multi-operator pipelines (τ→κ / τ→σ / τ→Φ): **opened**

UNNS has transitioned from *operator discovery* to **structural law testing**.

---

## 6. Navigation Tips

- Start with the **Operator Codex** if you want definitions
- Start with **Chamber XXXVI** if you want the key physical insight
- Start with **Chamber XXXVII** if you care about composability and pipelines
- Read papers only *after* chambers — not before
