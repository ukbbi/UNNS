# UNNS Phase E → F Bridge  
### Chamber XIX → Chamber XX Transition Documentation  
**Version vF.0.2 — 2025-11-12**  
**Author:** UNNS Research Collective

## 🧭 Purpose
The Phase E → F bridge establishes the architectural and theoretical connection between **Chamber XIX (Recursive Tensor Geometry)** and **Chamber XX (Maxwell-Analog Recursion Fields)**.  
Its goal is to transform validated two-field recursion dynamics into a generalized **tensor field engine** capable of computing divergence (Φ), curl (Ψ), and energy-coupling (E·B) observables—an analog to Maxwellian interactions within the UNNS substrate.

## 🧩 Core Concept
Phase E validated the tensor recursion equation:


where τ-fields evolve recursively under operator-differential dynamics.  
Phase F extends this by introducing **cross-field coupling** and **Maxwell-analog observables**:


This creates a *dual-field resonance system*—a discrete recursive environment where divergence and curl exchange energy through τ-feedback governed by coupling matrix αₖₗ.

## 📈 Observables & Validation
| Metric | Symbol | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Field Norms | ‖Φ‖, ‖Ψ‖ | Stability indicators |
| Coupling Energy | E·B | Maxwell-analog bridge strength |
| Antisymmetry Error | |R_xy + R_yx| | Tensor parity consistency |
| Divergence Sum | ΣΦ | Coherence / conservation check |
| FPS | — | Performance metric |

The system is considered **Phase F-ready** when:  
`|R_xy + R_yx| < 0.005`, `ΣΦ ≈ 0`, `|⟨E·B⟩| > 0`, and `energy_gradient < 1e-6`.

## 🔧 Developer Integration Notes
1. Inherit optimization logic from Chamber XIX (v19.1.2-CORRECTED).  
2. Maintain Laplacian caching, ImageData rendering, and normalized Δτ update loops.  
3. Extend HTML Guide with operator badges and bridge explanations.  
4. All module interfaces must validate schema before execution.  
5. No inline comments in delivered production files.
