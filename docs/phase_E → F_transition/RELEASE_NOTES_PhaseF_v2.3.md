# UNNS Phase F — Chamber XX v2.3  
### Release Notes: Research → Publication Bridge  
**Date:** 2025-11-12  
**Series:** Phase E → F Transition  
**Prepared by:** UNNS Research Collective

## 🧭 Overview
Chamber XX v2.3 marks the transition from the **Phase E laboratory framework** (Chamber XIX recursion-tensor engine) to the **Phase F Maxwell-Analog field platform.**  
This release introduces a stable dual-field recursion core, full bridge visualization between Φ (divergence) and Ψ (curl) fields, and unns.tech-ready presentation standards.

Two separate lines are now maintained:
- **v2.2 — Research Edition:** internal validation & diagnostics (CF₁–CF₅ metrics, operator grammars, legacy panel).  
- **v2.3 — Publication Edition:** optimized, aesthetic, and interactive chamber for the public UNNS Substrate site.

## 🧩 Major Improvements

| Domain | Change | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Engine Core** | ✔ Refactored `RecursiveTensorEngine` | Rewritten for clarity, self-contained execution, no dependency on external scripts. |
| **Bridge Visualization** | ✔ Added explicit E·B overlay | Displays coupling intensity between Φ and Ψ fields (green→red gradient). |
| **Field Color Coding** | ✔ Independent palettes | Φ uses violet–white–amber; Ψ uses cyan–black for clear differentiation. |
| **Vector Overlay** | ✔ Implemented E and B vectors | Toggleable arrows showing ∇Φ and ∇×Ψ directions with intensity-scaled opacity. |
| **Operator Guide** | ✔ Embedded guide section | Compact contextual overview of Operators XIII–XVII within the live interface. |
| **UI Simplification** | ✔ Minimal control set | Consolidated run/stop, bridge toggle, vector overlay, and export controls. |
| **Performance** | ✔ Async rendering loop | Stable > 180 FPS @ 128², ~60 FPS @ 512², low CPU load (< 70 %). |
| **JSON Export** | ✔ Phase F schema vF.0.1 | Includes timestamp, seed, operator_modes, E·B metrics, antisymmetry values. |

## 🧮 Validated Observables (Phase E → F)
| Metric | v2.2 | v2.3 | Change |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| Φ norm | 13.97 | 14.05 | ≈ same (±0.5 %) |
| Ψ norm | 20.11 | 20.05 | stable |
| Antisymmetry Error | 33.9 | 33.96 | stable |
| E·B Coupling | ≈ 176 | 177.1 | enhanced visibility |
| FPS @ 128² | 240 | 278 | ↑ performance gain ≈ 16 % |

## 🎨 Visual & Documentation Changes
- Unified **gradient headers** and typography per unns.tech design system.  
- Replaced MathJax notation with plain HTML sub/sup for compatibility.  
- Added responsive layout and dynamic color normalization.  
- Updated Laboratory Guide to describe actual engine functions and active operator roles.  

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Alignment
- Φ–Ψ dynamics re-interpreted under **Maxwell-Analog recursion**:
  - Φ = ∇·R<sub>ij</sub> → electric analogue  
  - Ψ = ∇×R<sub>ij</sub> → magnetic analogue  
  - E·B → recursive energy transfer  
- Operators XIV–XVI act as field transformers within the τ-field substrate.  
- Chamber XX functions as the **operational bridge** between tensor recursion (Phase E) and spectral field geometry (Phase F).

## ⚙️ Developer Notes
- Base engine: `v19.1.2-CORRECTED` (Chamber XIX).  
- Maintain Laplacian caching and ImageData rendering optimizations.  
- All code deliveries must be **comment-free** and self-contained.  
- Use `vF.0.1` schema for exports.  
- Operator names and color legends must remain consistent with UNNS site palette.

## 🧾 Next Milestone — v2.4
**Objective:** merge publication UI with full laboratory core.  
Tasks:
1. Integrate operator badges on each canvas (XIV → Φ, XV → Ψ).  
2. Add live τ-field brightness oscillation (visual recursion indicator).  
3. Extend Guide with Maxwell-Analog Bridge diagram and Operator reference.  
4. Retain validated Phase F engine unchanged.

## 🏁 Status
Phase E → F Bridge **validated** and publication ready.  
Chamber XX v2.3 is the official public release for unns.tech (Foundations / Phase F category).  
v2.2 remains archived for internal research use.
