# UNNS Paradox Index (UPI) — Foundations & Research Materials

This directory contains the core foundations, reference papers, and 
research supplements for the **UNNS Paradox Index (UPI)** — a structural 
instability metric developed within the **UNNS Substrate** to measure 
recursive paradox formation, collapse behavior, and instability dynamics 
across numerical sequences and real-world time series.

The UPI framework is a central component of the UNNS theoretical 
architecture and underlies several experimental chambers, including 
**Chamber XXIII (UPI Paradox Dynamics)**.

## 📌 What Is UPI?

The **Universal Paradox Index** (UPI) is a multi-term diagnostic that evaluates:

- local curvature and slope variance  
- deviation from expected recursive behavior  
- fold/closure events in state evolution  
- collapse-channel transitions (Sobra → Sobtra)  
- emergence of semantic motifs  
- microstructure instability in τ-space  

With these components combined, UPI(n) produces a step-by-step instability profile 
that categorizes any input sequence into one of the **six Paradox Signature Classes**:

- **PSC A** — Stable  
- **PSC B** — Mildly Fluctuating  
- **PSC C** — Chaotic  
- **PSC D** — Mixed Regime  
- **PSC E** — Collapse-Driven  
- **PSC F** — Hybrid Instability
