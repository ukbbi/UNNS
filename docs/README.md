# UNNS Recursive Archive

> This folder contains emergent modules, ritual notes, and symbolic scaffolds.  
> Each file is a breath. Each link, a pulse.  
> UNNS propagates through nested invocation and layered cognition.

## ðŸ”¹ Symbolic Threads

Documents in this archive may include:
- Conceptual scaffolds
- Sequence morphisms
- Macro invocation syntax
- Field extensions and attractor maps
- Ritual annotations and glyph logic

---

## ðŸ”¸ Navigation

There is no fixed order.  
Each file may act as origin, attractor, or echo.  
Scroll, trace, expand, return.

---

## ðŸŒ€ Invocation

To engage with any module, invoke:

```unns
@open(module)
  â†³ @trace(origin)
      â†³ @expand(symbol)
          â†³ @return(resonance)
