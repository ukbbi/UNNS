# UNNS Reality Bridge Telescope — Live Chamber  
### Interactive Projection Analysis Tool (Φ–Ψ–τ Observational Model)  
File: **`unns_reality_bridge_v1_2_STABLE.html`**

This directory contains the **stable Release v1.2** of the **UNNS Reality Bridge Telescope**, an interactive visualization chamber designed to demonstrate how recursive UNNS structures project into the observer’s “reality layer”.

The chamber implements the **Reality Bridge framework**, which connects:

- deep substrate recursion (τ-field + structural operators),  
- geometric & spectral behavior (Φ–Ψ dynamics),  
- observable projections (perceived stable structures),  
- and the operator-based “bridge stability” metric.

# 🔭 Purpose of the Reality Bridge Telescope

The Reality Bridge Telescope is designed to illustrate:

### **1. How recursion becomes “reality.”**  
It maps high-dimensional recursion processes to simplified observable structures.

### **2. How Φ–Ψ–τ dynamics shape perception.**  
Shows the transition between geometric (Φ) and spectral (Ψ) regimes.

### **3. Why some structures remain stable across projection.**  
Demonstrates observer-plane invariants.

### **4. When projection fails.**  
Displays projection drift, decoherence, and collapse thresholds.

# 🎓 **Tutorial: How to Use the Reality Bridge Telescope**

This section walks you through how to use the chamber effectively and understand its output.

---

# 1. **Opening the Chamber**

You can launch it either locally or from the website:

### **Option A — Online (recommended)**  
Open:  
🔗 https://unns.tech/labs/unns-reality-bridge-telescope-live-chamber

### **Option B — Local**  
Open the HTML file directly in a browser:


No installation needed.

---

# 2. **Understanding the Interface**

When the chamber opens, you will see three major regions:

### **A. Substrate View (Top-Left)**  
Displays the evolving τ-field.  
Patterns here show **true recursive dynamics** before projection.

### **B. Bridge Layer Diagnostic Panel (Right)**  
Shows:

- Φ–Ψ balance  
- Projection vectors  
- Bridge coherence  
- Drift and collapse warnings  

This is the “intermediate machinery.”

### **C. Observer Plane (Bottom)**  
Shows **what the observer actually perceives**, after filtering, stabilization, and Φ–Ψ–τ mapping.

This is the “observable reality.”

---

# 3. **Key Controls**

### **1. τ-Noise Slider**
Adds controlled stochastic variation.  
Low values = deterministic recursion.  
High values = stress-testing projection stability.

### **2. Φ-Weight / Ψ-Weight**
Adjusts which mode dominates:

- Higher **Φ** → geometric stability  
- Higher **Ψ** → spectral coherence (interference-like behavior)

### **3. Projection Smoothing**
Controls how aggressively the observer layer filters microstructure.

### **4. Reset & Re-seed**
Re-initializes recursion with new substrate conditions.

---

# 4. **What to Look For**

### **1. Bridge Coherence**
A number between **0 and 1**.

- 1.0 → perfect stability  
- 0.5 → partial drift  
- <0.2 → collapse or fragmentation  

This is the *health rating* of your projection.

### **2. Projection Drift**
Shows whether projection changes faster than recursion stabilizes.

High drift = “observer cannot lock onto a reality.”

### **3. Φ–Ψ Dynamics**
When Φ dominates → smooth geometric curves  
When Ψ dominates → branching filaments, oscillatory patterns  
At τ ≈ τ_crit → hybrid phenomena

---

# 5. **Suggested Experiments**

### **Experiment 1 — Geometric Lock-In**
- Increase Φ-weight  
- Lower Ψ-weight  
- Set noise to near-zero  
Observe: stable geometric structures.

### **Experiment 2 — Coherence Cascade**
- Set Ψ > Φ  
- Slowly increase noise  
Observe: interference-like waves become unstable.

### **Experiment 3 — Reality Collapse**
- Increase noise  
- Reduce smoothing  
- Lower Φ-weight  
Observe: projection loses consistency → bridge coherence drops → collapse.

### **Experiment 4 — Recovery After Collapse**
Click **Reset**, then gradually increase Φ-weight.  
Observe: projection regains structure.

---

# 6. **Interpreting the Results**

### The key philosophical message:

> **Reality is not what recursion is, but what survives projection.**

- Many recursive microstructures **never reach the observer.**  
- Φ stabilizes structure; Ψ destabilizes or enriches it, depending on context.  
- τ couples both and governs the evolution.  
- Collapse occurs when projection cannot maintain coherent structure.

This chamber is the first UNNS tool demonstrating this **observer-level filtering mechanism**.

---

# 7. **Tips for Best Use**

- Use Chrome or Firefox for smoothest performance.  
- Keep window size medium; canvas scales automatically.  
- Avoid extreme Ψ + high noise unless intentionally exploring collapse.  
- Use Reset frequently when exploring parameter edges.  

---

# 8. **Future Extensions**

The next planned versions will include:

- Time-averaged stability maps  
- τ-field curvature visualizer  
- Observer-plane persistence tracking  
- Bridge vector field animation
