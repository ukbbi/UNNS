# UNNS Protocols Realignment Changelog

**File:** `unns-protocols_fa_REALIGNED.html`  
**Date:** December 14, 2025  
**Status:** Surgical realignment complete — ontology scaffold preserved, physics overclaims removed

---

## Summary

This realignment transformed `unns-protocols_fa.html` from a **physics manifesto** into a **projection protocol map** — a conceptual atlas showing how recursive UNNS structures can be systematically mapped onto familiar mathematical formalisms **without asserting physical reality**.

**Classification Change:**
- ❌ Before: "Complete theoretical physics framework"
- ✅ After: Ontology Scaffold / Conceptual Atlas

**Epistemic Posture Change:**
- ❌ Before: Claims about reality ("unified theory", "resolves paradoxes")
- ✅ After: Exploratory methodology ("investigates", "explores", "maps")

---

## Critical Changes

### 1. Title & Subtitle (Lines 214-227)

**Before:**
```html
<h1>UNNS Physics Protocols: Recursive Foundations of Physical Theory</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Recursive Construction of Action, Curvature, and Collapse</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<h1>UNNS Projection Protocols</h1>
<div class="subtitle">From Recursive Substrate to Conceptual Physical Analogues</div>
<div style="...">
    <strong>Interpretation Note (2025)</strong><br><br>
    This page does <em>not</em> present a physical theory or predictive model.
    It documents <strong>projection protocols</strong>: structured ways in which
    recursive UNNS constructs may be mapped onto familiar mathematical and
    physical formalisms for exploratory and diagnostic purposes.
    <br><br>
    These mappings are <strong>non-unique, non-empirical, and non-committal</strong>.
    Their role is to investigate which invariants survive projection from the
    recursive substrate — not to assert physical reality.
</div>
```

**Impact:** Single most important change — immediately reframes entire document

### 2. HTML Page Title (Line 6)

**Before:**
```html
<title>UNNS Protocols: From Recursion to Reality</title>
```

**After:**
```html
<title>UNNS Projection Protocols: From Recursive Substrate to Conceptual Analogues</title>
```

### 3. Overview Section (Line 246)

**Before:**
> "The UNNS Physics Protocols construct a **complete theoretical physics framework** from recursive number sequences. This journey progresses through eleven interconnected protocols, each building upon the previous to create a **unified theory** that spans from quantum mechanics to gravity."

**After:**
> "The UNNS Projection Protocols document **structured mappings** from recursive substrate to mathematical formalisms. This journey progresses through eleven interconnected protocols, each exploring how **recursive invariants project onto familiar structures** spanning algebraic, variational, superposition, and geometric closure regimes."

**After:** "Maps recursive sequences into vector spaces as **exploratory coordinate systems**"

#### Classical Field Layer → Variational Projection Layer
**Before:** "Introduces dynamics through action principles"  
**After:** "Explores action principles and conservation laws as **organizational constraints**"

#### Quantum Layer → Superposition Projection Layer

### 5. Subsection Header Softening

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Core Innovations | Structural Features |
| Physics Parallels | Conceptual Analogues |

### 6. "Why This Matters" — Complete Rewrite

**Before (physics claims):**
- "paradigm shift in theoretical physics"
- "path toward the long-sought **theory of everything**"
- "Reality emerges from information processing"
- "Classical paradoxes... are naturally resolved"

**After (methodological contribution):**
- "paradigm shift in **exploring mathematical structures**"
- "substrate capable of **hosting multiple theoretical structures**"
- "systematically identify which structural properties **survive mapping**"
- "Provides a **systematic framework** for investigating how familiar physical and mathematical concepts might relate to discrete recursive processes"

**Impact:** Removes all claims about physics, focuses on methodology

---

### 7. Geometric Closure Layer Bullet Points (Lines 327-330)

**Before:**
- Discrete Ricci curvature from gauge holonomies
- Holographic principle: I(Bulk) ≤ S(Boundary)
- Black holes from recursion collapse
- Information paradox **resolution** via repair operators

**After:**
- Discrete curvature **analogues** from gauge holonomies
- Holographic **encoding patterns**: I(Bulk) ≤ S(Boundary)
- Collapse structures as **black hole metaphors**
- **Exploring** information-theoretic repair mechanisms

### 8. Animation Text (Lines 887, 898)

**Before:**
```javascript
<text>REALITY</text>
<text>Emergent from Recursion</text>
...
"Reality emerges from the recursive substrate"
```

**After:**
```javascript
<text>REALITY</text>
<text>Projected Structure</text>
...
"Structures may be representable as recursive projections"
```

## What Was NOT Changed

The following were preserved **intentionally**:

✅ **All mathematical notation** (equations, operators, symbols)  
✅ **Physics terminology** (gauge, quantum, gravity) — now understood as *semantic borrowing*  
✅ **Visual structure** (layers, flows, emergence diagrams)  
✅ **Domain tags** (Quantum Computing, Cosmology, etc.) — now *exploratory domains*  
✅ **Conceptual narrative** (recursive substrate → projections)

**Rationale:** These elements remain valid as projection constructs. Only their *interpretation* changed.

---

## Verification Checklist

✅ Title reframed: "Projection Protocols"  
✅ Interpretation disclaimer added  
✅ "Complete framework" → "structured mappings"  
✅ "Unified theory" removed  
✅ "Emergent reality" → "projected structure"  
✅ Layer names updated to projection language  
✅ "Revolutionary" → "Geometric/Structural"  
✅ "Applications" → "Exploratory Domains"  
✅ "Paradox resolution" → "Exploring mechanisms"  
✅ Animation text softened  
✅ Page title updated

## Classification Tags (For Archive)

**Type:** Ontology / Conceptual Map  
**Phase:** Pre-Operator-F formalization  
**Status:** Valid, exploratory, non-empirical  
**Epistemic:** Non-committal projection framework

## Why This Realignment Works

### ✅ Preserves Value
- Still shows **structural continuity** across mathematical regimes
- Still demonstrates **emergence intuition** visually
- Still attracts the right kind of thinker (now more accurately)

### ✅ Removes Risk
- No longer makes **unfalsifiable physics claims**
- No longer asserts **predictive power** without evidence
- No longer confuses **analogy with identity**

### ✅ Enables Future Work
- Becomes a **gateway ontology page** for UNNS Laboratory
- Compatible with empirical work (Chamber XXVIII+)
- Survives skeptical review as exploratory framework

## Usage Recommendation

This realigned version should be:
1. **Deployed** on unns.tech as the primary conceptual introduction
2. **Referenced** in academic contexts as "projection methodology"
3. **Updated** with cross-links to validated chambers (XIV, XXV, XXVI)
4. **Maintained** with this non-committal framing going forward

**Do NOT revert** to physics claims without empirical validation.
