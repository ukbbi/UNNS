# Real Data Sources (UNNS Laboratory)

All frequency datasets in this folder originate from public scientific
sources, primarily:

• NIST ASD — https://physics.nist.gov/asd
• JPL Molecular Spectroscopy Catalog
• Peer-reviewed hyperfine measurements (individual citations inside each JSON)

Datasets have been reformatted into UNNS JSON standard:
{ frequency_MHz, uncertainty_MHz, A_parallel, A_perp, bw_correction, transition }
