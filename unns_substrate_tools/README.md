# UNNS Substrate Tools

This folder contains core interactive artifacts developed within the **UNNS (Unbounded Nested Number Sequences) Substrate** project.

The files collected here are **tools**, not final statements.  
They support exploration, organization, and interpretation of recursive structures within the evolving UNNS framework.

At this stage of the project, **ontology and exploration are allowed to co-evolve**.  
No artifact in this folder should be read as closed, final, or exclusive.

## Contents

### 1. `operator_registry_refactored.html`

**UNNS Operator Registry**

An interactive registry that organizes known recursive systems and attractors using the UNNS operator vocabulary (Φ, Ψ, τ, XII, τ-MSC).

**Purpose**
- Provides a comparative map of recursive structures
- Makes operator-based interpretations explicit
- Helps relate different systems through shared structural behavior

**Notes**
- The registry is declarative in nature
- It does not simulate, compute, or predict
- Classifications should be read as **contextual ontological statements**, open to revision as UNNS develops

### 2. `unns-algebraic-geometric-engine.html`

**UNNS Algebraic–Geometric Engine**

An interactive exploratory chamber for observing how symbolic expressions behave under recursive and geometric transformations.

**Purpose**
- Explore generativity, structure, curvature, and collapse-related behavior
- Visualize stability, oscillation, symmetry, and breakdown regimes
- Support intuition and hypothesis formation within UNNS

**Notes**
- The engine is exploratory and computational
- It may produce strong internal classifications or verdicts
- Such outputs are **context-dependent and provisional**, not final declarations of truth

## How to Read These Tools Together

These two artifacts are complementary:

- The **Engine** explores *how* structures behave under recursion  
- The **Registry** organizes *how such behaviors may be interpreted* within UNNS  

Neither invalidates the other.  
Exploration may inform ontology; ontology may guide exploration.

No automatic pipeline or hierarchy is enforced.

## Project Status

UNNS is at an **early and open stage of development**.

- Definitions may change  
- Operators may be refined  
- Classifications may be revised  
- New tools may alter interpretation  

This folder intentionally avoids rigid boundaries to allow the substrate to grow.
