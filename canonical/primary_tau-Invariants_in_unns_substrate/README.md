📘 Primary τ-Invariants in the UNNS Substrate

This folder contains the theoretical foundation, formal completeness results, and operational validation instruments supporting the UNNS τ-invariant framework.

It represents the canonical reference bundle for:

the Primary τ-Basis theorem,

its corollaries (1–4),

and the Chamber implementations that act as operational witnesses, not discovery engines.

📄 Primary τ-Invariants in the UNNS Substrate.pdf

Core theoretical paper

Establishes:

The Primary τ-Basis:
√2 (orthogonal closure), e (relaxation), π (projection geometry)

Formal definitions of:

τ-closure

irreducibility

primariness

Corollaries 1–4:

Derived τ-structures

Uniqueness of the basis

Collapse consistency (Operator XII)

Stability without primariness

This paper is foundational: all chambers in this folder operate under its constraints.

📄 MECHANISM COMPLETENESS THEOREM.pdf

Theoretical reinforcement

Purpose:

Eliminates circularity concerns

Proves mechanism exhaustiveness

Shows no fourth irreducible τ-closure principle can exist without violating closure axioms

This document locks the basis, preventing later extensions from destabilizing the theory.

Operator XIV — τ-Invariant Validator

Role:

Classifies a given structure against τ-closure criteria

Measures:

closure residual Δτ

closure signature

stability under refinement

Key property:
🚫 Not a discovery engine
✅ A corollary witness

🧪 chamber_xiv_b_v1.0.0_INLINE.html

Chamber XIV-B — Recursive Emergence Explorer

Role:

Exhaustively explores derived structure space

Confirms absence of additional τ-primaries

Produces negative-result validation

What it establishes:

Derived structures are abundant

Stability ≠ primariness

τ-closure uniqueness holds empirically

Operator XII behavior is preserved

🔒 Conceptual Guardrails

This folder does not:

claim new τ-invariants

extend the τ-basis

treat Operator XII as generative

blur theory with exploratory extensions

All results here are classification + validation only.
