# UNNS — Layered Admissibility & Structural Growth

This folder collects finalized research artifacts that consolidate the **Layered Admissibility** results (Chambers XXXV–XXXVI) and their broader conceptual implications for the UNNS Substrate.

The materials here are **post-validation**, intended for reference, dissemination, and conceptual integration rather than active experimentation.

## Contents

### 📄 Research Papers (PDF)

- **Empirical Separation of Ω-Level Stationarity and τ-Level Admissibility**  
  Establishes, using validated data from Chamber XXXVI, that Ω-level background stationarity and τ-level operator admissibility are structurally separable.  
  This result reframes questions of gravity, quantization, and semiclassical limits within UNNS.

- **Complete Landscape of Layered Admissibility in the UNNS Substrate**  
  A comprehensive four-mode analysis (A/B/C/D) mapping admissibility regimes, anomalies, and failure modes.  
  Serves as the extended, archival treatment of the layered framework.

### 🌐 Interactive / Expository HTML

- **`chamber_xxxvi_structural_redesign.html`**  
  Public-facing, structurally redesigned Chamber XXXVI interface.  
  Focuses on *structure over outcome*, emphasizing layer relationships, diagnostics, and admissibility separation.

- **`sideways_growth_article_1.html`**  
  Conceptual essay explaining why genuine UNNS complexity grows *sideways* (via stratification and admissibility) rather than *upwards* (via scale or energy).  
  This essay provides philosophical and methodological context for the Chamber XXXVI results.

## Conceptual Role in UNNS

These artifacts collectively:

- Confirm **empirical separation** between structural background coherence (Ω) and operator dynamics (τ).
- Clarify why quantization is admissible at the τ-level but destabilizing at the Ω-level without additional structure.
- Motivate the transition from **admissibility testing** (Phase A / Chamber XXXV–XXXVI) to **operator composability** (Phase F / Chamber XXXVII).
- Provide conceptual grounding for later multi-operator pipelines (τ → κ, τ → σ, τ → Φ).

*UNNS treats structure as primary and observables as projections.  
This folder documents the point where that principle becomes empirically unavoidable.*
