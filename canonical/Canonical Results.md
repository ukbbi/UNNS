# UNNS Canonical Results

This directory contains the **canonical, validated results** of the UNNS Substrate program to date.
Each subfolder represents a completed stage in the transition from static mathematical structure
to a predictive, dynamical, and necessary substrate.

The sequence L1–L4 documents how the UNNS Substrate progressed from identifying invariant structure
to demonstrating inevitability under controlled falsification.

No speculative claims are included here.
Each stage is grounded in reproducible experiments, formal analysis, and explicit acceptance criteria.

## L1 — Structural Invariants

**What was established**

- Identification of stable numerical and symbolic structures (τ-invariants)
- Demonstration that certain constants persist under recursive refinement
- Replacement of “numerical coincidence” with structural survivability

**Key outcome**

Constants such as π, e, and √2 are not treated as arbitrary discoveries.
They emerge as **structures that survive recursive collapse** under UNNS rules.

A constant is reinterpreted as a **closed mechanism**:
if it were not closed, it would not persist.

**Status**

Structural existence established, dynamics not yet addressed.

---

## L2 — Dynamic Refinement and Flow

**What was established**

- Introduction of refinement dynamics over invariant structures
- Demonstration that persistence does not imply smooth propagation
- Discovery of refinement motifs such as *cycle-with-leak*

**Key outcome**

Persistence ≠ conservation.

A structure may survive collapse while still losing information during refinement.
This separates:
- existence (closure),
- from behavior (flow).

**Status**

Dynamics established, selection mechanism still unresolved.

---

## L3 — Least-Divergence Selection

**What was established**

- Resolution of the “choice problem” in branching refinement trees
- Empirical identification of **least-divergence geodesics**
- Robustness under decision-level perturbations

**Key outcome**

When multiple refinement paths are available, the system consistently selects
those minimizing internal divergence.

This principle plays the same structural role as
the **Principle of Least Action** in physics,
but operates at a pre-geometric, recursive level.

**Status**

Selection mechanism identified and shown to be robust, but not yet inevitable.

---

## L4 — Universality and Necessity

**What was established**

- Introduction of **ordering noise** (history perturbation)
- Demonstration of invariance under exploration-order disruption
- Discovery of a sharp transition at the **discrete cost quantum scale**
- Confirmation that least-divergence endpoints persist under falsification attempts

**Key outcome**

Least-divergence selection is **not heuristic**,
**not algorithm-dependent**,
and **not contingent on exploration history**.

Once exploration is sufficiently complete,
the same outcomes are reached regardless of order.

Robustness becomes **necessity**.

**Status**

Validation complete.
The UNNS Substrate is now a predictive, dynamical system.

## What This Means

Taken together, L1–L4 establish the UNNS Substrate as a **pre-geometric engine** that:

- generates invariant structure,
- governs refinement dynamics,
- selects admissible paths via least divergence,
- and enforces necessity under perturbation.

Geometry, probability, and physical law appear not as foundations,
but as **projections** of deeper recursive constraints.

The program has transitioned from:
> “Does this structure exist?”  
to  
> “Why must this structure exist?”

---

## Current Phase

**Validation is closed.**

Future work moves beyond confirmation toward:
- mechanism coupling,
- projection formation,
- cross-grammar interaction,
- and emergence of physical law.

From here on, the program proceeds by **extension, not repair**.

---

## Reproducibility

All canonical results are:
- deterministic at baseline,
- statistically replicated under perturbation,
- fully auditable via chambers and exported data.

No result depends on narrative interpretation.

---

## Canonical Status

This directory defines the **current state of the UNNS Substrate**.
Subsequent work must be consistent with — or explicitly extend — these results.
