# Collapse Universality in the UNNS Substrate (Canonical)

This folder contains the **canonical research material** associated with the
Collapse Universality result in the UNNS Substrate.

It aggregates:
- the formal written argument (PDF),
- and the concrete operational Chambers that realize, test, and visualize
  collapse universality across multiple operator regimes.

This is **not** a public-facing tutorial folder.
It is a canonical reference point tying together theory and executable substrate artifacts.

## Contents

### Core Document
- **Collapse Universality in the UNNS Substrate.pdf**  
  Formal exposition of collapse universality as a substrate-level phenomenon:
  collapse appears as an operator-invariant attractor across admissible recursive systems.

### Chambers (Operational Evidence)
- `chambers_xiv_xv_xxviii/`  
  Interactive Chambers implementing and probing collapse universality
  under different operators, regimes, and abstraction layers.

## Conceptual Role

In UNNS terms, *collapse universality* asserts that:

> Collapse (Operator XII) is not a model-dependent artifact,  
> but a **structural outcome of τ-admissibility under recursive pressure**.

This folder anchors that claim by keeping:
- theory,
- instrumentation,
- and cross-chamber evidence

**co-located and versioned together**.
