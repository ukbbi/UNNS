# Collapse Universality — Chambers XII, XIV, XV, XXVIII

This folder contains the **operational Chambers** supporting the
Collapse Universality result in the UNNS Substrate.

Each Chamber implements a different perspective on how collapse (Operator XII)
emerges under recursive evolution — yet all converge on the same structural outcome.

## Included Chambers

### Chamber XIV — INLINE
- `chamber_xiv_INLINE.html`
- Minimal, direct recursion
- Collapse observed without auxiliary structure
- Establishes baseline inevitability

### Chamber XV — PRISM
- `chamber_xv_PRISM.html`
- Multi-path / refracted recursion
- Demonstrates collapse under branching and recombination

### Chamber XXVIII — COMPLETE
- `chamber_xxviii_v1.3_COMPLETE.html`
- Full operator stack
- Explicit τ-admissibility, regime transitions, and collapse statistics
- Serves as the most comprehensive validation

---

## Supporting Labs

- `high_order_operators_lab.html`
- `high_order_operators_lab_enhanced.html`
- `unns-lab_v0.4.2.html`

These are **instrumental extensions**, not standalone proofs.
They expose operator behavior at higher recursion orders and parameter ranges.

## Conceptual Interpretation

Across all Chambers, the same pattern appears:

- Collapse does **not** depend on:
  - initial conditions,
  - operator ordering,
  - or representational detail.

- Collapse **does** depend on:
  - τ-thresholds,
  - recursive pressure,
  - and admissibility failure accumulation.

This convergence is what justifies the term **universality**.

## How to Read These Chambers

These files are **not demonstrations** in the pedagogical sense.

They are:
- executable substrate probes,
- designed to be inspected, rerun, and stressed,
- not merely observed visually.

Each Chamber answers a different question,
but all answer the same meta-question:

> “Does collapse persist when everything else changes?”

---

## Maintenance & Integrity

- Do **not** simplify or “clean up” these Chambers.
- Do **not** normalize visuals across files — differences are intentional.
- Do **not** extract individual Chambers without preserving this grouping.

Their meaning is **collective**, not isolated.
